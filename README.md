# Social-Network API

# Description 

This project involves creating the back end for a social network application. Most social network websites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok have features that allow users to comment or create posts. This project has the same functionality where users can create a new user, new 'thought', and a new 'reaction' (where a 'thought' is equivalent to a post and a 'reaction' is equivalent to a comment). It also allows users to add 'friends' to other users (equivalent to adding a connection on LinkedIn or Facebook).

## Usage

1. Install MongoDB on your machine
2. Clone the repository
3. Install needed dependencies with `npm -i`
4. Run `npm start` to run the server
5. Use Insomnia Core or your browser to test the REST API
